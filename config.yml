  port_limitations: <span>Applications running on Cloud Foundry receive requests through the URLs configured for the application. HTTP requests arrive on ports 80 and 443. Additionally, Cloud Foundry requires a channel for TCP/WebSocket traffic.<br><br>Some production load balancers require separate ports for HTTP and TCP/WebSocket traffic. HAProxy allows both kinds of traffic on the same port. However, HAProxy is suitable for only lab and test environments. Applications deployed with the default settings of <code>cf-release</code> use port 4443 for TCP/WebSocket communications. To assign TCP/WebSocket traffic to a different port, you must make the following changes:<ul><li> Set the value of the <code>port</code> sub-key of the <code>logger\_endpoint</code> key in your manifest.</li><li> Configure your HAProxy or load balancer to receive TCP traffic on the port you specified. This configuration enables you to access logs from your app with the <code>cf logs APP_NAME</code> command.</li></ul> Note that if you remove the <code>port</code> sub-key from your manifest, you must configure port 443 for TCP/WebSocket traffic in your load balancer or HAProxy.</span>
