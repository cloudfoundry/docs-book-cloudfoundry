  platform_ssh_configuration: Cloud Foundry deployments control SSH access to apps at the Cloud Foundry level. Additionally, Cloud Foundry supports load balancing of SSH sessions. The [Configuring SSH Access](../../running/config-ssh.html) topic describes how to set SSH access for your deployment.

  manifest_vs_cli_asg: You may also define ASGs in your Cloud Foundry deployment manifest, but these definitions only create security groups during first-time installation. To avoid confusion, any such definitions in the manifest should be generic. The cf CLI commands create-security-group and bind-security-group overwrite ASG definitions from the manifest. Upgrading Cloud Foundry retains ASG definitions made from the CLI and ignores any ASG definitions in the newer manifest.

  port_limitations: "Applications running on Cloud Foundry receive requests through the URLs configured for the application. HTTP requests arrive on ports 80 and 443. Additionally, Cloud Foundry requires a channel for TCP/WebSocket traffic. The default <code>cf-release</code> manifest assigns port 4443 for TCP/WebSocket communications.<br><br>If your load balancer requires that you use a different port for TCP/WebSocket traffic, you must do the following in order to access logs from your app with the <code>cf logs APP\\_NAME</code> command: <ul><li>Set the value of the <code>port</code> sub-key of the <code>logger\\_endpoint</code> key in your manifest to the required value.</li><li>Configure your HAProxy or load balancer to receive TCP traffic on the port that you specified.</li></ul>"
