  manifest_vs_cli_asg: You may also define ASGs in your Cloud Foundry deployment manifest, but these definitions only create security groups during first-time installation.

Upgrading Cloud Foundry retains ASG definitions made from the CLI and ignores any ASG definitions in the newer manifest.

  route_services_config: <h2><a id='enabling-route-services-in-cloudfoundry'></a>Enabling Route Services in Cloud Foundry </h2>To enable support for Route Services in a Cloud Foundry deployment, the operator must provide a passphrase used by the Gorouter to encrypt a header that is sent with the request to the route service. The Gorouter uses this header to validate the request sent by the route service to the application route. The passphrase is configured in the cf-release manifest.<br><pre><code>properties<span>:</span><br> router<span>:</span><br>   route\_services\_secret<span>:</span> YOUR-SECRET-PASSPHRASE</code></pre><p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><span>:</span> The <code>route\_services\_secret</code> property should be a robust passphrase. See the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release/blob/master/jobs/gorouter/spec">Gorouter spec</a> in cf-release for more details.</p>Route Service instances should send requests to the value of x-cf-forwarded-url, obeying the scheme. The scheme is https by default; for environments that do not support TLS termination, this property can be set to false.<pre><code>properties<span>:</span><br> router<span>:</span><br>   route\_services\_recommend\_https<span>:</span> true</code></pre>The CF router will only forward requests to Route Services over SSL. By default, certificates provided by Route Services must be signed by a trusted CA. If they are not, the CF router will reject the request. In development environments this concern may be unreasonable. To disable SSL certificate validation, modify the following property<span>:</span><br><pre><code>properties<span>:</span><br>  router<span>:</span><br>    ssl\_skip\_validation<span>:</span> true</code></pre>
