## What's in this Repo

This repo uses the [Bookbinder gem](http://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-bookbinder) to generate the documentation as a web application.

The config.yml file contains the list of topic repositories.

The master_middleman folder contains the layouts, styles, and subnav used to create the web pages.

This repository does not contain the documentation content. Documentation content is contained in the topic repositories listed in the config.yml.

## Contributing Pull Requests

To submit a pull request to the documentation, follow this process:

1. Make sure you have a signed CLA. Even if you aren't contributing running code, we still need a Contributor License Agreement.

1. Fork the content repository you want to make a contribution to. See the following examples:
  * For the Buildpacks Docs at http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/index.html, the content repo is: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-buildpacks.
  * For the Developer Guide Docs at http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/, the content repo is: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-dev-guide

1. Clone your fork of the content repository. Make sure to clone your fork of the topic repository to a directory that is a sibling to this book repository. So, for example, if you are contributing content to the Buildpack documentation, your folder structure would look like this:

  <pre>

    |
    +-- docs-book-cloudfoundry
    |
    +-- docs-buildpacks
    |
  </pre>

1. Make your changes.

1. Run bookbinder on your local changes:

  <pre>
    $ cd docs-book-cloudfoundry
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec bookbinder watch
  </pre>

  Bookbinder attempts to assemble the doc set from your local copies.
  It skips any topic repositories that you do not have checked out. For more information on Bookbinder, see the <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder#bookbinder">Bookbinder README</a>.

1. Point your browser at <code>localhost:4567</code> to preview your changes. On save, your browser will reload with any additional changes you make.

1. Commit your changes, rebase from upstream, and push to your fork.

1. Submit a pull request (PR) from your fork to the original repositories.

The CF Docs team will review and merge the PR. They may contact you with questions or edit the PR for formatting and style.
**Note**: After your pull request is merged, your changes appear on [docs.cloudfoundry.org](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org) the next time the cf-docs team pushes updates to the production docs. Updates go live at least once a week.

## Determine Content Repos and Branches of a Book

The `config.yml` defines the content repos for each book.
The `config.yml` file of each book contains the list of content repos and branches that appear in the doc set.
In the `config.yml` file, each content repo is specified in the `repository` subsection.
This subsection includes an optional `ref` key-value pair which defines the branch of the content repo the book uses.

Make sure that you are adding your content to the correct branches of the content repos.

To determine which branch of a content repo a book version uses:

1. Confirm that you are on the correct book branch. For example, the currently published doc might be on the `master` branch
or on the branch corresponding to its version number.

2. Open the `config.yml` file.

3. Search for the name of the content repo, for example, `docs-cloudfoundry-concepts`.

4. Review the `repository` subsection for the content repo. If there is no `ref:` tag, then the repo uses the `main` branch. If there is a `ref` key-value pair, it specifies the branch name of the content repo. For example,

  ```
  - repository:
    name: cloudfoundry/docs-cloudfoundry-concepts
    ref: '225'
  ```

  `ref: '225'` refers to the 225 branch of the docs-cloudfoundry-concepts repo. Cloud Foundry v225 is associated with the PCF v1.6 release.
